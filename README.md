Here's a summary of the meeting discussion and action items in a first-person view for documentation purposes:

During the meeting, we discussed various aspects of our internal configuration and how to handle certain scenarios using existing conditional actions. Thavakalsha suggested defining the scope of configuration control and considering alternative solutions if needed. Chiranjeevi mentioned the possibility of generating scripts from the backend based on conditions and updating rules accordingly.

Sabik raised concerns about the limitations of conditional actions supporting only one action and the need to run multiple notes patterns based on conditions. We agreed that understanding the exact business case is crucial for implementing the right solution.

Chiranjeevi demonstrated a notes pattern used previously and discussed the complexity of conditions and routing based on elements like hierarchy changes. We discussed the need for training and control over configuration access to avoid data discrepancies.

Veeraputrayya emphasized the need for specific questions and mentioned blockers like date conditions and history tracking requirements. Shah's input was sought regarding development efforts for UI changes and runtime impacts of complex conditions.

We concluded that most requirements can be handled through conditional actions without code-level development, although certain complex conditions and date-based actions may require further exploration. We also discussed hardware requirements and system stability, acknowledging the need for continuous improvement post-implementation.

Action items were assigned as follows:

1. Define Scope of Configuration Control - Owner: Thavakalsha Hanifa
2. Evaluate System Performance and SLA Definitions - Owner: Mynam Veeraputrayya Babu
3. Investigate Date-Based Conditions and Historical Tracking - Owner: Shah (Development Team)
4. Review Hardware Requirements and System Stability - Owner: Chiranjeevi Mallavelli
5. Document Meeting Minutes and Follow-Up Actions - Owner: Sabik Meerangani

These action items aim to address key areas discussed during the meeting and ensure a smooth implementation process.
